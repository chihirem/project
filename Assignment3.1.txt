ALGORITHM Check(A[0..n-1])
//Input: An array A[0..n-1] of n real numbers
  x->A[0]; y->A[0]
  for i?1 to n-1 do
   if A[i]<x
   x->A[i]
   if A[i]>y
   y->A[i]
return y-x

>>Enter the Array with 5 values. A[5,3,4,2,8]

>>The Algorithm computes substraction between the values present in y and x.

>>The basic operation is,
	>We initialize x and y value with the first number present in the array i.e., x=5,y=5
	>We do the iteration upto the last element of an array using for loop.
	>Then we check the condition between the second element and element present in x.
	>If the second element is smaller than the value present in the x then return the second element into x.
	>If the second element is greater than the value present in the y then return the second element into y.
	>Now substract the value present in x and y (y-x).

>>This operation repeats for 4 times i.e., n-1 times.

>>Time Efficiency of the algorithm is O(n)
