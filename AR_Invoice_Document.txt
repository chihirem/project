Table Creation:

SQL Statements-->	CREATE TABLE AR_INVOICE_TBL(INVOICE_NUMBER NUMBER,
						INVOICE_DATE DATE,
						CUSTOMER_NAME VARCHAR2(25),
						CUSTOMER_BILL_TO VARCHAR2(100),
						CUSTOMER_SHIP_TO VARCHAR2(100),
						INVOICE_CURRENCY VARCHAR2(15),
						INVOICE_AMOUNT NUMBER,
						INVOICE_LINE_NUMBER NUMBER,
						ITEM_NUMBER NUMBER,
						ITEM_DESCRIPTION VARCHAR2(100),
						TAX_CODE NUMBER,
						TAX_AMOUNT NUMBER,
						);


-->			INSERT INTO AR_INVOICE_TBL VALUES(&INVOICE_NUMBER,&INVOICE_DATE,'&CUSTOMER_NAME','&CUSTOMER_BILL_TO',
							 '&CUSTOMER_SHIP_TO','&INVOICE_CURRENCY',&INVOICE_AMOUNT,&INVOICE_LINE_NUMBER,
							  &ITEM_NUMBER,'&ITEM_DESCRIPTION',&TAX_CODE,&TAX_AMOUNT);



Report Creation:

Creating a report manually :

DATA MODEL: 

1. Start Oracle Reports by clicking the Reports Builder icon on your desktop. The welcome screen displays. Select the option Build a new report manually. Click OK.

2. If Reports Builder is already open, create a new report by selecting File > New > Report  from the menu. 

    In both cases, the Data Model view of the Report Editor displays. 

3. Add a query to the data model by selecting Insert > Query  from the menu. This action invokes the Data Wizard. 

4. For the data source, accept SQL Query  as the data source type by clicking Next. 

    SQL Query:

    SELECT INVOICE_NUMBER,INVOICE_DATE,CUSTOMER_NAME,CUSTOMER_BILL_TO,CUSTOMER_SHIP_TO,

    INVOICE_CURRENCY,INVOICE_AMOUNT,INVOICE_LINE_NUMBER,ITEM_NUMBER,ITEM_DESCRIPTION,

    TAX_CODE,TAX_AMOUNT FROM AR_INVOICE_TBL WHERE CUSTOMER_NAME:=OU_NAME;


5. On the data source definition page, click 'Connect' to connect to the database. 

In the Connect dialog box, enter appsread for the User Name, appsread for the Password, and the name of your database for the Database field.

6. Fetch the appropriate table from the database.

PAPER LAYOUT:


1. Once your data model is complete, you need to create a layout for the data objects to display in the report output.

2. Design the report based on the user requirement and save the report(XX3_AR_INVOICE_REPORT.rdf).

WINSCP:

1. Go to winscp, copy the file from the local machine to server and save the report in the path(dbfiles/applcsf/cust/us/reports)

ORACLE APPLICATION:

1. Create Executable: Link it to Report file(.rdf) created

Navigation: Login into Oracle Applications –> Go to Application Developer Responsibility –> Concurrent –> Executable

	Executable	   :XX3_AR_INVOICE_EX

	Short name	   :XX3_AR_INVOICE_EX

	Application	   :

	Execution method   :ORACLE REPORTS

	Execution file name:XX3_AR_INVOICE_REPORT

2. To create a value set: 

Navigation: Log in to Oracle with the Application Developer responsibility -> Application -> Validation -> Set, the Values Sets window will open.

We need to enter:

	Value Set Name	   :AR_VALUESET

	Description        :

	List Type          :List of Values

	Security Type      :No Security

	Format Type        :Char

	Maximum Size       :20

	Validation Type    :Table

3. After Developing a report to register as a concurrent program.

Navigation: Application Developer –> Concurrent –> Program

	Program		   :AR_INVOICE_REPORT_PGM

	Short name	   :AR_INVOICE_REPORT_PGM

	Application	   :

Click on Parameters then enter the following details:

	Program		   :AR_INVOICE_REPORT_PGM

	Application	   :

	Sequence No 	   :1

	Parameter	   :OU_NAME

	Valueset	   :AR_VALUESET

	Default type	   :constant

	Token	           :OU_NAME


4. Create Concurrent Program: Link to it executable defined in previous step

5. Enter Parameters and link Value Sets

6. Assign the registered Concurrent Program to a request group

Navigation: Switch to “System Administrator” Responsibility –> Security –> Responsibility –> Request

Action: Enter Your User Readable Name of your concurrent program

Action: Save

Now Your Concurrent Program is ready to run.

Switch to appropriate responsibility and run the concurrent program.
